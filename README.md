### GEE_Workflow_Templates
#### This repository is where I will be storing Jupyter Notebook templates that outline the general workflow(s) to accomplish specific remote sensing based tasks using Google Earth Engine. 

Much of what will be stored in this repository will act as reference guides for colleagues and collaborators who wish to perform detailed tasks but do not wish to figure out the workflow on their own. Following these templates provides condidence that the code will work without (much) issue and allows for consistency. Furthermore, these templates can act as educational references to learn RadGEEToolbox / GEE functionality for specific tasks. 

The templates used here may also be used as example notebooks for the RadGEEToolbox package, but it felt worth separating to a new repo for origanization.

This repo will be updated semi-regularly.
